#basic types
  Lists
  Sets
  Maps

#Lists
  store list of objects
  duplicates
  keeps ordering
  elements are indexed with an int
  checking if an item is in list is slow (O = n)
  lookup by index is fast (O = 1)
  can be sorted (O = n logn)
 
#Sets
  no duplicates
  not indexed
  checking if an item is in list is fast (O = 1 ||  log n)
  objects need to implement hashCode() and equals()
  order is not preserved / never established 

#Maps
  key-value pairs
  retrieving by value is fast (O = 1 || O = log n)
  iterating over map values is slow
  objects  as keys need to implement hashCode() and equals() 
  
#Subtypes
  ArrayLists - dynamic Arrays, int index
  LinkedList - dynamic Arrays, no index
  HashSet
  TreeSet - stores items in natural order, must implement Comparable
  LinkedHashSet
  HashMap
  TreeMap - stores items natural order, must implement Comparable
  LinkedHashMap - keys remain in order
